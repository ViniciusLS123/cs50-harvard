Week 1 â€“ C

In the second module of CS50, I started learning the C programming language.  
The focus was on understanding **compilation, data types, operators, conditionals, loops, and functions**.

Here are the main projects I implemented:

1) Hello, world
My first C program to print text on the screen.
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    printf("Hello, world!\n");
}
