Week 0 – Scratch

In the first module of CS50, I worked with **Scratch** to learn the basics of programming logic without writing text-based code.  
The goal was to explore **conditions, loops, variables, and events** in a visual way.

Here are the projects I built:

1) Interactive Sprite
A sprite asks the user a question and reacts differently depending on the answer.  
[Project](./scratch_projects/Interactive_Sprite.sb3)

2) Maze Game
A small maze game where the player needs to reach the exit without touching the walls or moving obstacles.
[Project](scratch_projects/Maze_Game.sb3)

3) Timed Click Challenge
The goal is to click the sprite as many times as possible before the timer runs out.  
[Project](scratch_projects/Timed_Click_Challenge.sb3)

4) Shape Drawing
Using the **Pen** extension and loops to draw repeating colorful geometric patterns.  
[Project](scratch_projects/Shape_Drawing.sb3)

5) Number Guessing Game
The computer picks a random number and the player has to guess it, with hints like “higher” or “lower.”  
[Project](scratch_projects/Number_Guessing_Game.sb3)

How to run
1. Go to the [Scratch online editor](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/editor/).  
2. Click **File → Load from your computer**.  
3. Select one of the `.sb3` files.  
4. Press the **green flag** to start.

What I learned
- How to structure small projects using control blocks.  
- Thinking in terms of **input, process, and output**.  
- Creating simple games and animations to practice programming logic.
